# WebMap
Python project working with folium and pandas


This project is exposure to folium and pandas, opening local files, parsing through them and returning the values that I call. 

This map is of the volcanoes within the US, accesing the JSON and txt files it is able to find the elevation and color code the markers placed on the map (these are placed using the lat. and lon. from the data)

Next step is to control the layering so you can click the marker and reval the location and elevation
